I watched you from a distance… wishing you would one day feel the same about me. I wanted to be yours and wanted nothing more than to make you mine. I could hardly contain myself when you were around… and I would breathe deeply when you were close to me. I wanted to remember every moment and every detail of who you were. You would smile at me with your eyes when we talked… and when you walked away all I wanted was to follow. You were beautiful, smart and funny… and I felt like you were totally out of my reach. I wanted to spend time with you… but you were with someone else. I wanted to be with you… but I was too young. I carried a crush for you for the entire time I knew you. I would go to visit because I knew you’d be there. Your laugh was addicting. Even being next to you made me feel good. So I admired you, wanted and desired you from a distance… for years and years. I always wanted you around… and always wanted to be around you. The timing just wasn’t right… for any of it.</p><p>But times change, things change…. We’ve changed. I’m back in your life… and you’re back in mine. All I want is to take the moments we have now and make them the times of our lives. I’ve spent so many years loving you from a distance and want to love you face to face now. Our relationship as friends has evolved and developed from years and years of getting to know each other… and from developing feelings we never thought we would have or feel. The following text is a letter I wrote to you, but never sent you. From Florida, a long time ago… when things were still new, but very meaningful:</p></div><div class=letters><blockquote cite=http://www.adriansane.com>I guess…. I’m having trouble adapting to being alone here in florida. It’s just harder to deal with than I expected. I don’t think I’ve ever been completely alone like this before. Normally I take situations I’m in and find ways to learn from them. I keep looking for the lesson but I don’t find it. You know I like to socialize…. be with people….. this is really bothering me. I really….. really feel alone. I can’t stop thinking about this move to NY….. and to be honest…. I can’t stop thinking about you either…. and what will happen after i get there. I cool with planning the move and the steps I have to take to get there…. that’s fine… but the only thing I can’t account for… is what will happen with us after I get there. And it drives me crazy because I don’t know what to expect… I know things are being thought about… and its a slow process…. whatever…. I fine with it mami…. We’ve talked about this. But you…. are the only thing I can’t seem to look forward to….. because I don’t know. You’re the only thing I cant plan for…..I wish you could just give me a sign or something. Just something to tell me we’re going in the right direction. I’m just getting impatient because I want to start this new chapter already…… and I’m dying to make you a part of it. You know what sucks the most? The fact that you can talk to your friends about me….. if you even do….. you can reach out and get feedback. I don’t talk to anybody about you. I cant talk to you… and get feedback about the situation I’m in…. with you. That’s like being stuck in the axis of the universe….. but this whole long rant is just me… talking to you… about you…… a thousand messages between us is nothing compared to a moment in person…… I know I may sound like a broken record by now… but…. i really like you Larissa….. I’m trying really hard not to make an ass of myself. Trying to play it cool… and I am….. for the most part. It may sound sad but you really are just about the only person I talk to. And I don’t want sympathy….. just something to look forward to…. if I can….. it really may be asking a lot…. because there’s still a lot to say…. I dunno. Please don’t think that I’m completely bananas or a weirdo that get his head together. I’m just in a very unique situation that I’ve never experienced before…. and I’m bugging out a bit. Sidenote: I’m not asking you to hold my hand or baby me…. I know you hate that shit (you’ve told me). Trust me im a very mature and capable man. You just make me….. eager. I don’t wanna say that i believe in destiny cuz that’s just cliché…. but i do believe that life had a way of making good things happen….. for good reasons. Think about this…. I went to NY…. to see you…. to finally express how I was starting to feel about you. In the process of being with you… spending time with you….. I found out that there is a google headquarters in NY. If I hadn’t been bold enough to go and face you with what I felt…. I would’ve never known this. You didn’t want my move or my decisions to be about you…. but they are….. even if they’re small… they’re still significant….. and are part of a larger movement. I miss my family, i miss my friends, I miss NY, and I don’t wanna miss the chance to love you more as a friend. Google has more than 10 pages of open positions in the NY branch. I’m applying for a lot of them. Doesn’t mean ill get any of them…… but I would’ve never known if it wasn’t for you. Cant promise you the world… but I can promise you’ll never have a dull moment…. honesty….. loyalty….. and fidelity. I’m taking time with a wounded hand…… all I ask for in return…. is for a little reassurance. I really like you… and I’m so afraid that you’re going to find somebody before I get the chance to show you how much. You’ve told me before that you cant stand it when you feel that you have to hold somebody’s hand….. and I’m a man… I don’t need you to hold my hand…. but i just wish you would reciprocate some feelings…. something to show me that I’m on the right track…. or at least show me how YOU feel…. I feel like for the most part its one-sided. And I know its way too early to even be thinking about stuff….. so I don’t….. because I don’t want to push you away or turn you off……. I don’t question anything…. I don’t ask for much…. all I do is talk…… and listen… because it’s all I can do. I’m just ready to start…. and it seems like the time for me start is being pushed back farther and farther…….and I’m growing impatient… not with you…. but with the circumstances I’m in…. and its driving me crazy being alone….. it really is. I wish I was surrounded by people who miss me… and love me…. and enjoy my company. I’ve really learned to appreciate the small things that people offer. I’m trying so hard to make a future for myself…. and for the people I want to share it with. all I get is setbacks and failures. I feel like I’m at the end of a very long rope…. I try and try to climb back up but always wind up back at the bottom. I plan and sacrifice a lot to obtain my goals… and I don’t bitch about anything….. I crumble and put myself back together all the time. I’ve fallen so much that my knees can barely hold the weight anymore……</blockquote></div><div class=outro><p>I’ve written many words in countless letters to you… most I’ve never had the courage to send, sometimes the timing wasn’t right, and other times what I had written just seemed irrelevant. I’ve used my words to try to grab your attention, to try to keep your attention… and to verbally fight for what I felt…. and feel for you. You’ve misinterpreted my words sometimes. Made assumptions based on what I said but, what I feel could never be fully expressed in letters written on the train, or alone in my home. What I feel needs to be expressed in person, face to face, eye to eye, and heart to heart. This is why I assume you don’t open up in person. You’ve had it all wrong… from the beginning. You see, I never asked you to be my everything…. No my love, <a href=img/helluvawalk.jpg target=blank>What I wanted… was to be yours</a>.</p></div></div>
